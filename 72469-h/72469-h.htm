  <h2 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Art. I.</span>—NEW GAOL FOR THE CITY OF BALTIMORE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>We hear with unfeigned pleasure of any improvement in
the construction of city and county gaols. Convinced as we
have been for many years, and by testimony from innumerable
sources, that in most of them we shall find a fruitful soil for the
production and growth of criminal purposes and habits, we can
conceive of few objects of municipal oversight which demand
earlier or closer attention. What the gaol does to make a bad
man worse, the penitentiary cannot easily undo. If a thief or
burglar or counterfeiter, while waiting for trial or sentence,
serves a few weeks’ or months’ apprenticeship to one or more
adepts in those branches in a gaol, he is a very unpromising
subject of penitentiary discipline. He is, perhaps, rather braced
against any influences which may be employed to change his
course of life, and buoyed up with the anticipation of pursuing
his criminal projects under more favorable circumstances,
and with greater skill and success, upon the termination of his
sentence.</p>

<p class='c015'>So deep are our convictions of the immeasurable evils inflicted
on the community by bad gaols, that we accept an attempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>to improve them, in any respect, as a token of good. If a cell
that was dirty yesterday is clean to-day—if the sexes are separated—if,
instead of allowing prisoners to herd together day
and night, they are separated by night—if for darkness, dampness
and a pestilential atmosphere, the light and air have free
access—if, in a word, there is some decent respect shown to
the species represented in these suspected and perhaps fallen,
degraded, and certainly discreditable specimens of it—we take
courage.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of course we are prepared to congratulate our fellow-citizens
of Baltimore, on the completion of a new and imposing city
gaol. And though we could have wished they had adopted
the principle of individual separation—which we cannot but
regard as indispensable under any system, both as the <i>duty</i> of
society and as the <i>right</i> of the offender—still, a well-constructed,
wholesome prison, properly governed, does credit to the
wisdom and humanity of the public authorities, and will, in the
end, prove altogether the most economical.</p>

<p class='c015'>The following description of the gaol, illustrated as it is by
the accompanying engravings, will give our readers the means
of judging for themselves of the design and character of the
new edifice:</p>

<p class='c016'>The jail stands in close proximity to the penitentiary, and
comprises a centre building, and north and south wings.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is a block of cells in each of the two wings, 15 cells
in length, 2 in width, and 5 stories in height, making 300 cells
in the two wings, for the confinement of prisoners.</p>

<p class='c017'>These two wings are on what is known as the “Auburn
plan,” being a prison within a prison. The cells are surrounded
by corridors formed between the block of cells and the
exterior walls.</p>

<p class='c017'>The cells are 8 feet by 11 feet, and about 10 feet high, they
are built of bricks, with segment and arched ceilings, and brick
floors; each cell has an iron grated door and window opening
into the corridors. The corridors are 13 feet wide, and have
floors of hard flag stone on a level with the floors of the first
story cells, they are open from this floor to the top of the upper
story cells.</p>

<p class='c017'>All of the cells above the first story are reached by galleries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>and staircases of iron. Each cell has a ventilating flue constructed
in the wall, with an opening into the lower part of the
flue for the reception of the prisoner’s night pail, to be closed
with an iron slide, and another opening near the top of the
cell for ventilation, which is also provided with an iron slide,
by which it may be closed. These flues all open into a large
ventiduct constructed on the tops of the blocks of cells, the
vitiated air is taken from the cells through these flues and airducts,
by means of large ejecting ventilators, placed on the roof
and connected with the ventiducts.</p>

<p class='c017'>Light and air is admitted in abundance by the large windows
in the exterior walls.</p>

<p class='c017'>There are five sink rooms in each of the four corner towers,
making one sink room for each range of fifteen cells; the iron
galleries are continued across the corridors to the sink rooms,
and each one is fitted up with an enamelled iron hopper and
trap, through which the contents of the night pails are discharged
into the soil pipes and sewers; there is also an iron
sink with a sufficient supply of water. Each sink room has
two windows for light and ventilation.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is a tank in the upper story of each of the four towers
to insure a constant and adequate supply of water.</p>

<p class='c017'>The guard room in the centre building is 57 feet 6 inches
by 59 feet 6 inches, and about 38 feet high, and is separated
from the wings by heavy iron screens or gratings, to confine the
prisoners to the corridors and galleries of each wing at such times
as they may be allowed privileges outside of the cells; these
screens are constructed so as not to obstruct the view into the
wings from the guard room. The corridors, stairs and galleries
of the wings all being in full view from the guard room—the
floor of which is on a level with the lower gallery of the wings,
and is formed of 144 plates of cast iron, supported on rolled
iron beams, so arranged as to form a bearing for all the four
sides of each plate, the beams being supported by nine iron
columns and the four side walls. The guard room is lighted
by three very large windows. The only entrance to either the
north or south wing is through the guard room.</p>

<p class='c017'>The kitchen, in which all the cooking, baking, washing, &#38;c.
will be done, is under the guard room and on a level with the
first story of cells, and is of the same size as the guard room,
and 11 feet high.</p>

<p class='c017'>The cooking and the heating water for the various purposes
is all to be done by steam, and the baking in two brick ovens.
The kitchen is lighted by three windows in the east side, two
angle windows in the west side, and 4 floor lights, taking the
place of four of the iron plates of the guard room floor.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>There are two rooms in the front part of the centre building
on a level with the kitchen for the reception of prisoners, one
on each side of a vestibule through which they are entered—they
are fitted up with iron bath tubs, water closets, and a fumigating
oven for the purpose of cleansing the filthy before
placing them in their cells.</p>

<p class='c017'>The entrance to these reception rooms is under the landing
of the steps to the upper vestibule, and there is an iron staircase
from the lower to the upper vestibule, by which the prisoners
are taken from the reception rooms or lower entrance to the
guard room and cells.</p>

<p class='c017'>The two rooms in the front part of the centre building, on
a level with the guard room, are for the use of the warden and
his deputies.</p>

<p class='c017'>There are six rooms in the front part of the centre building
for the confinement of witnesses, or for privilege rooms, four of
which are about 20 feet square, and the other two about 15
feet square; these rooms have private water closets, and are
supplied with water, they have high ceilings, are well ventilated,
light, pleasant, and cheerful; they are approached by
private staircases in the two towers of the front part of the
centre building, and are connected with the galleries of the
north and south wings by a gallery on the west side of the
guard room.</p>

<p class='c017'>There are three hospital rooms in the upper story of the front
part of the centre building, they have private water closets,
bath tubs, with warm and cold water, and shower, they can be
reached from the cells of the north and south wings by the
gallery through the guard room and iron staircases, and also
from the stairs in the front towers; they are well lighted and
ventilated.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is a water tank in the upper part of the centre
building to supply the kitchen, water closets, baths, wash
basins, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c017'>The chapel is in the upper part of the centre building over
the guard room. It will seat over 400 persons. There is an entrance
to it from each of the wings, and also from the front part
of the centre building. It is about 22 feet high, well lighted and
ventilated, and so planned that the prisoners can be separated
into classes if deemed desirable. The chapel floor is supported
by two double lattice wrought iron girders.</p>

<p class='c017'>There are ventilating flues and ejecting ventilators constructed
in all parts of the centre building, and all of the windows and
other openings throughout, are made secure by wrought iron
gratings. All the floors are on iron beams and brick arches.
The building is thoroughly fire proof in all parts except the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>chapel and roof framing, and is warmed by steam from two
large boilers located in the boiler house on the east side of the
jail, and lighted at night by gas. There is a thorough system
of drainage from all of the waste pipes, soil pipes, and rain
water pipes, through brick drains and sewers to Jones’ Falls, a
stream running within about 200 feet of the jail.</p>

<p class='c017'>The entrance gateway and lodge, the clerk’s office and the
residence for the warden, are on the south side of the jail lot,
fronting on Madison street. There are two chambers over the
lodge and office on the east side of the gateway. In the Warden’s
residence, on the west side of the gateway, there is a
kitchen, dining room, parlor, five chambers, and bath room,
with hall passages, pantry, store rooms and closets, and all
other requisite appurtenances and conveniences for the comfortable
accommodation of a family. The yard for the warden’s
residence is separated from the jail yard by a stone wall and
iron gate.</p>

<p class='c017'>The prisoners are received and discharged through the gates
on Madison street.</p>

<p class='c017'>The exterior walls of the jail and other buildings are all of
stone, together with all the corbels, copings, quoins, chimney
tops, &#38;c. The base, up to the second range of window sills, is
of granite, cut and set in large blocks. The walls above the
base are of light blue stone, laid in rubbled masonry, with
splayed jambs and arches. The window sills above the basement,
and the quoins, corbels, copings and other dressings are
of marble. The roofs are of slate. The interior walls, arches,
&#38;c., are all of brick.</p>

<p class='c017'>The site is a good one, being easy of access from all parts of
the city, and convenient to the court house and penitentiary.
There is ample space on all sides for a free circulation of air.
The lot has a gentle ascent to the north and east, and a dry
self-draining gravel sub-soil. Its proximity to Jones’ Falls,
and its elevation above the water level, affords the best means
of drainage.</p>

<p class='c017'>In designing this prison and working out the various details
of the plan, we endeavored to carry out the following general
principles, viz:</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Confinement of prisoners in separate cells, so far as deemed
desirable.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Separation into classes.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. The cells so arranged that their doors and windows may
have open gratings, and yet so as that a prisoner cannot from
his cell see into any other cells or into any other part of the
building except the corridor opposite his own cell.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>4. The corridors so arranged and located that prisoners can,
with convenience and safety, be allowed privileges in them.</p>

<p class='c017'>5. Pleasant and convenient yet perfectly secure rooms, for
the confinement of witnesses, entirely separate from the other
parts of the prison.</p>

<p class='c017'>6. No apartment for the confinement of a prisoner to be
below the surface of the ground.</p>

<p class='c017'>7. An unobstructed view of the corridors, galleries and
stairs from the guard room.</p>

<p class='c017'>8. Central location for the kitchen, the chapel and all other
offices.</p>

<p class='c017'>9. Convenient means of ingress and egress.</p>

<p class='c017'>10. Such an arrangement of plan as would secure the greatest
benefit of sunshine on the exterior walls and into the corridors
and rooms, and admit of the free movements of the currents
of air around and throughout the building.</p>

<p class='c017'>11. An abundant supply of water, properly distributed
throughout all parts of the prison, and a suitable number of
bath tubs, water closets, hoppers and sinks to promote cleanliness
among the prisoners and in the prison.</p>

<p class='c017'>12. The sink rooms so located and arranged as to prevent
their contaminating the atmosphere of the prison.</p>

<p class='c017'>13. Effectual means for warming, and a thorough system of
ventilation, and means for admitting an abundant supply of
fresh air and light to all parts of the building.</p>

<p class='c017'>14. All parts of the building in which the prisoners are to
be confined to be thoroughly fire proof, and to be so secure as
to preclude all hope of escape therefrom.</p>

<p class='c017'>15. Hospital rooms to be conveniently located in a quiet
part of the building.</p>

<p class='c017'>16. The residence for the Warden’s family not to be in the
jail, but on the jail lot, and very convenient to the entrance to
the jail.</p>

<p class='c017'>17. Simplicity and economy, in plan and construction, so far
as consistent with the other essential requirements.</p>

<p class='c017'>And finally to provide, by every possible means consistent
with security, a proper degree of economy and a salutary discipline
for the healthfulness, comfort and convenience of the
prisoners; for while a prison is a place of confinement for criminals
or persons charged with crime, and as such should be made
so secure as to shut out all reasonable hope of escape, that the
proper ends of justice may be met, yet humanity and indeed
justice herself demands that the life and health of the prisoners
shall be carefully protected, and every suitable means afforded
them for repentance and moral improvement.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>The architectural style of the building is castellated Gothic,
and presents in the durable stone of which the building is erected
those simple, yet bold, strong and massive features which
convey the idea of fitness—that basis of all proportion—which
affords to us an emotion of pleasure, or that feeling of satisfaction
arising from the contemplation of means properly adapted
to their end, and possessing those qualities of order and
harmony which excite our admiration. Any attempt at mere
architectural display, by elaborate ornamentation or expensive
finish, would have been the work of supererogation. Propriety
and fitness forbid the use of elaborate embellishment. Strength
and security should be the most prominent features in the design
for a prison, that it may by its austere beauty wear a suitable
expression, and thus proclaim with truthfulness the purpose
for which it is designed.</p>

<p class='c014'>The total cost of gaol, warden’s residence, heating, cooking,
&#38;c., is not far from $290,000.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Art. II.</span>—TEXAS PENITENTIARY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In March, 1848, the Legislature of Texas, in pursuance of
a provision in the State Constitution, passed an act authorizing
the Governor to appoint three Commissioners to select a location,
and report the details, for the erection of a Penitentiary;
the action of the Commissioners to be subject to the approval
of the Governor. After careful and full consideration of the
comparative advantages of the several sites offered, the town
of Huntsville, the county seat of Walker county, was selected,
and the selection approved.</p>

<p class='c015'>Walker county lies just under the thirty-first degree of north
latitude, and between the eighteenth and nineteenth degrees
of longitude west from Washington; and the Trinity river
forms its north-eastern boundary. Huntsville is very nearly
the geographical centre of the county, and is about one hundred
and twenty miles a little west of north from Galveston;
and about one hundred and sixty miles north of west from
Austin, the capital of the State. The town stands upon a low
gravelly ridge, bare of trees, and with deep ravines upon three
sides. Some few scattered houses, as well as Austin College
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>and the Andrew Female College, are built upon corresponding
ridges, which rise on the opposite sides of these ravines.
There is no extended growth of heavy timber in the immediate
vicinity of the town. The approach from the east for some five
or six miles, is through a sandy region covered with a dense
growth of scrub oak and underbrush. Upon the west and
south the country is more open, gradually merging into the
rolling prairies of Grimes and Washington counties. Small
streams run through the ravines and find their way into the
lesser branches of the Trinity and San Jacinto rivers; but the
supply of water is irregular and the ravines are often dry.
The situation is a healthy one, the air pure and bracing, and
the climate favorable. The town is regularly incorporated,
and has from sixteen hundred to seventeen hundred inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c015'>Upon the eastern outskirt of the town, on both sides of the
main road from the lower Red River country, are the buildings
and grounds of the Penitentiary. The main buildings and
enclosure are upon the southern side of the road, and extend
back down the slope of the ravine, with a gradual and slight
descent. Upon the opposite side of the road are the storehouse
and warehouse: the storehouse, which includes under
the same roof the offices and residence of the Financial Agent,
is sixty feet front by fifty deep, and two stories high; the
warehouse is about forty feet front by fifty deep, and two
stories high. The two buildings are separated from each other
by an open space of some two hundred feet front; the intervening
ground, together with a considerable lot in the rear
extending back of the storehouse and warehouse, is mostly
under cultivation as a vegetable garden for the convicts. The
warehouse is used for storing the wool and cotton for the
factory. In the storehouse are kept the manufactured goods
for sale. The front of the Penitentiary faces north, and extends
a distance of some three hundred feet directly upon the
road without any intervening fence or wall. The storehouse
and warehouse are immediately opposite the respective extremities
of the front, the main entrance of the Penitentiary
in the centre, facing the open space above mentioned. The
front elevation consists of a centre building some sixty feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>front and three stories high, with two wings, each one hundred
and twenty feet long and two stories high. The entire front
presents one uniform extent of brick wall upon the same line
for the whole distance, unbroken by any recesses or openings
except the large, but plain, arched gateway in the centre and
the rows of windows; and unrelieved by a single projection or
attempt at ornamental or architectural display. The only
thing to relieve the monotonous uniformity of the front is the
additional story upon the centre building. The bricks of
which all the Penitentiary buildings are built are made in the
neighborhood, and are coarse and of a dingy red color.</p>

<p class='c015'>At the main entrance, the large, solid, double leafed door,
which mostly stands wide open in the day time, is stationed a
guard, armed with a six-shooter in his belt, and a double-barreled
shot-gun, loaded with buck-shot and ready capped, in
his hands. An admission fee of twenty-five cents is charged
for each visitor, and the amount received goes into the general
accounts of the prison, and very nearly defrays the expense of
the extra guard who is kept for the express purpose of waiting
on visitors through the establishment. Any one, however, who
has a higher motive than mere curiosity, and desires to examine
the condition and management of the Penitentiary through an
interest in the subject of prisons and prison discipline, and will
make himself known to the Superintendent, will always be
courteously received and every facility afforded for his inquiries
and observations without charge. Passing through the archway,
the visitor is admitted by the guard through the large
grated iron gate which closes its inner end, into the yard of
the prison. In the middle of the yard is a two story log-house,
used now as the shoemaker’s shop, but built originally as a
place of confinement for the convicts who were employed in
the erection of the Penitentiary. The entire space enclosed
within the limits of the prison walls is about three hundred
feet square: the enclosure upon the northern side is formed by
the front or main building; the southern side of the enclosure
and the portions of the eastern and western sides adjacent
thereto, are shut in by substantial brick walls; while the rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>of the eastern and western sides is formed by ranges of buildings
connected with the main edifice. Just within the prison
wall upon the southern side of the yard is the factory, a substantial
building of brick, two stories high and two hundred
and seventy feet long by fifty deep. Both cotton and woolen
goods, chiefly of the coarser kind in demand for plantation
wear, are manufactured. The establishment of the factory
was authorized by the Legislature at the session of 1853 and
1854, and an appropriation made for the erection of the building,
and the purchase of the necessary machinery. Carding
and spinning were commenced in June, 1856, and the first
loom started late in July of the same year. Steam power is
used to drive the machinery, and the factory has been kept
steadily in operation from the time of its commencement, the
number of looms having been gradually increased as the success
of the undertaking developed itself. The machinery was all
made in Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c015'>The results of the employment of convict labor in this
department of manufactures, is regarded by the Directors and
officers of the Penitentiary, as a decided pecuniary success;
and the Osnaburgs and woolens made here bear a high reputation
throughout the State, and are undoubtedly of most excellent
quality and finish.</p>

<p class='c015'>The centre building of the front is about forty feet deep,
and is occupied for the offices and residence of the Superintendent
and other prison officers, except the Financial Agent.
The lower story is curtailed in room by the archway passing
through its entire depth, and affording access for vehicles as
well as persons to the prison yard. The wings are occupied
entirely for cells: these are built in three tiers one above the
other from the floor (which is but slightly raised from the
level of the ground) to the roof. The tiers of cells are entirely
separated from the exterior walls of the building by corridors
about six feet wide, which are open from the floor to the
roof of the buildings; access to the cells in the second and
third tiers being had from narrow galleries reached by stairways,
one at the end of each wing nearest the centre building.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>One of the buildings upon the western side of the square is
also occupied for cells arranged in similar tiers. Each cell is
eight feet long by five wide, and eight feet high. The door of
each is a grating of cross-barred iron, and affords the only
means of ventilation and the only access for light; and as the
doors are but five feet high, with the bottom edge on a level
with the floor, the ventilation is necessarily imperfect. All
the air is introduced from the corridors, and the windows of the
corridors which open to the outer air, are small in size and
not very numerous. The corridors, however, are sufficiently
lighted for all ordinary purposes, except perhaps on very
dark days. The interior of the cells and the walls of the
corridors are kept thoroughly whitewashed. There are no
water closets in the cells, but each is furnished with a movable
vessel. In addition to the cot with its bedding, each cell is
provided with a small table and stool, and a few have some
one or two other small articles of furniture. There is no
uniformity of neatness or cleanliness in the cells, the care of
each being entrusted to its occupant; and beyond a certain,
not very high standard, no special attention to these matters
is enforced.</p>

<p class='c015'>The buildings upon the eastern and western sides of the
prison yard, afford accommodations for the cook-house or
kitchen, blacksmith and wagon shops, in addition to a range
of cells. The meals are all served to the prisoners in the cells—breakfast
before they leave in the morning, and supper after
their return at night. For dinner they are mustered from
their work at the ringing of the bell at noon, marched back to
their cells, and after dinner conducted again to their work.
The provisions are of good quality and well cooked. The
rations per day of each convict are, a pound and a half of
beef, or three quarters of a pound of mess pork or bacon, and
a pound and a half of corn-meal. Sometimes mutton is furnished
in place of the beef, and the fresh meat is given on
alternate days. To each hundred rations there are allowed
six pounds of sugar, five pounds of coffee, fourteen pounds of
flour, three pounds of soap, sufficient salt, vinegar and pepper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>for seasoning, three gallons of molasses, eight quarts of beans
or peas, and vegetables whenever they can be procured. <i>Each
convict who chews tobacco has one half plug per week furnished
him.</i></p>

<p class='c015'>The floors and ceilings of the cells and the roofs of the
prison buildings are of wood, and a few years since the
prisoners occupying three cells one over the other, made their
escape by cutting through the floors and roof, and so getting
down upon the outside. Since that occurrence the prisoners
have been searched regularly twice a-day—once when they
return to their cells for dinner, and again at supper time.</p>

<p class='c015'>There were one hundred and eighty-two convicts in the
Penitentiary at the time of our first visit, and two others were
brought in on the day of our second visit. One cannot but be
struck with the number of Mexicans, easily distinguishable by
their dark complexions; long, straight, jet-black hair, and
piercing black eyes. A very large proportion of the convicts
are imprisoned for horse stealing, the most common form of
larceny in this State; and which is very severely punished, the
sentences ranging as high as fifteen years. There were no
negroes in the prison. But very few free negroes are met with
in the State; and for the higher classes of offences for which
a white man or free negro would be sent to the Penitentiary, a
slave is hung. The outer clothing of the convicts consists of
a round jacket and pantaloons of the goods manufactured in
the Penitentiary, cotton in summer and woolen in winter, with
black wool hats. The jacket and pantaloons are each one-half
dark and the other half light colored—the dark half of the
jacket and the light half of the pantaloons being on the same
side of the body, and <i>vice versa</i>. Osnaburg shirts, brogans,
and wool socks complete the dress, each article of which bears
a number corresponding with the cell occupied by the wearer;
the numbers upon the articles of outer clothing being large
and conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c015'>All convicts who can read are furnished with a copy of the
Bible, the Mexicans with Bibles in the Spanish language.
They are also permitted to read such other religious or moral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>works as the Chaplain may approve. They can have but little
opportunity for reading except on Sundays, when they are
confined in their cells all day, with the exception of the time
of public worship. The Chaplain preaches regularly on the
Sabbath twice a-day. There is no chapel or hall provided for
assembling the convicts. The convicts are marched out of
their cells, each bringing his stool with him, and ranged along
the opposite sides of one of the long narrow corridors, in no
very strict or regular order. The Chaplain stands about the
middle of the corridor, while at each end are the guards fully
armed; the Superintendent is also present.</p>

<p class='c015'>By a special enactment of the Legislature, the front of the
cell of any prisoner sentenced to solitary confinement for
life, is painted black, and his name and sentence distinctly
marked thereon. The object would seem to be to infuse a
salutary dread into the minds of the other prisoners. Upon
the only black-painted cell in the prison was the following inscription,
in distinct white letters: <i>William Brown, aged
twenty-four years, convicted for murder in Grimes County,
spring term, 1858, for which he is now suffering solitary confinement
for life</i>. Brown himself, however, was in fact at
work in the factory with the other convicts! He entered the
Penitentiary in May, 1859, and had been kept in close confinement
in his cell, <i>without labor</i>, never being permitted to
leave it for any purpose, until about the first of October,
when his health was found to have suffered so much that, to
preserve his life, he was, under a discretionary power vested in
the Directors, released from the rigor of his sentence, and
subjected to only the ordinary confinement of the prison. His
health had since greatly improved. It is not to be wondered at
that his health should decline under the strict enforcement of
such a sentence. The cell in which he was confined was the
same as to size, ventilation, and light as the rest; and being
one of the lower tier of cells, the top of the doorway was some
feet below the lower edge of the windows upon the opposite
side of the corridor in the outside wall. He had even less
chance for fresh air than if his cell had been in almost any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>other location. It is the sight and knowledge of such instances
of solitary <i>unemployed</i> confinement as this, and a wilful neglect
or refusal to inform themselves upon, and recognize, the very
wide distinction between the terms <i>separate</i> and <i>solitary</i>, that
renders many persons so violently prejudiced against, and
opposed to the “Separate System.”</p>

<p class='c015'>There were but three female convicts. One was undergoing
a sentence for arson, and the other two had been convicted of
murder. One of these latter occupied a cell immediately under
one in which her husband was suffering imprisonment, as an
accomplice of his wife in the crime for which she was sentenced.
She had murdered her father, to get his money. The husband
of the other woman had died, in prison, but a few weeks previous
to our visit. He, too, had been convicted as an accomplice
of his wife; the victim of their crime being a niece of the
wife, who had excited her jealousy.</p>

<p class='c015'>Each prisoner occupies his own separate cell at night and
during meal-times. Among the prisoners was a boy of seventeen,
who had been sent there for want of any better place for
him: his offence was stabbing. In consequence of his youth,
he was not subjected to the same strictness of discipline as the
other convicts, and was allowed many privileges, occasionally
even being allowed to sleep in the same cell with another convict.
His opportunities of intercourse with the others must
have been frequent, and the association will, in all probability,
prove most disastrous in its consequences. His return to the
Penitentiary, in the course of a few years at most, can be calculated
on with reasonable certainty. Whatever disposition he
may show, or whatever efforts he may make, upon his release,
to lead a proper life,—all will be neutralized, almost inevitably,
by the knowledge of the fact that he has been a convict in the
penitentiary; and some of those who have been his fellow-convicts,
of a more hardened experience in crime, will be
constantly on the watch to lead him astray, and with an
influence of great power.</p>

<p class='c015'>The grades of punishment for refractory convicts are: 1st.
Confinement in the dark cell. 2d. Confinement on bread and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>water. 3d. Confinement, and deprivation of tobacco. 4th.
Irons, with or without confinement. 5th. Standing in the
stocks. Flogging is also permitted, but only by special order
of the Directors, to whom the Superintendent reports any case
he may think deserving of that punishment, and the Directors
decide on the expediency of the infliction. It cannot,
however, in any case, exceed one hundred lashes, and is administered
with a leather strap.</p>

<p class='c015'>In case any of the prisoners escape, one of the guards has
some two or three hounds trained to catch runaways, and used
to track the fugitives. As some of the prisoners are employed
outside the prison yard, about the storehouse and warehouse,
and in the garden, the opportunity thus presented, for attempting
an escape, is sometimes improved; and the dogs are then
brought into use. Escape, however, is a matter of difficulty;
and the attempt, even, is hazardous: for, in addition to the
armed guard at the main entrance, the immediate vicinity of
the prison premises is further watched and protected by armed
guards, on duty constantly, in guard-houses a little distance
from the walls, outside,—one at each corner, and one opposite
the middle of each side, except the front.</p>

<p class='c015'>Visitors are not allowed to hold any communication with the
convicts, either by word or sign; nor are the master-workmen
allowed to hold any conversation with them, except in giving
necessary information or direction concerning their work. The
master-workmen are also forbidden to converse, in the hearing
of convicts, with other persons on matters foreign to their
work. The convicts are also prohibited from holding any communication
among themselves; but the impossibility of preventing
this entirely, was manifest, and, indeed, was frankly
admitted. The friends and relatives of any convict are permitted
to see and converse with him, in the presence of the
Superintendent, at his discretion.</p>

<p class='c015'>The officers of the Penitentiary are,—a Superintendent, Financial
Agent, and three Directors; all of whom are appointed
by the Governor, for four years. In addition to these, the
master-workmen, physician, chaplain, sergeant of the guard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and steward, are considered as officers of the prison, and all
hold their appointments from the Directors. The salaries of
the Superintendent and Financial Agent are $1,500 per annum,
each; of the Directors, $250 each; of the Physician, $500;
and of the Chaplain, $250.</p>

<p class='c015'>The present Superintendent is Col. J. H. Murray, who has
been in office some eighteen months. He is a gentleman of
liberal and intelligent views, and feels the responsibilities of his
office. To his courtesy and attention we were indebted for the
opportunity of obtaining much of the foregoing information.
The present Chaplain is a Presbyterian; but ministers of other
denominations occasionally supply his place. Any convict who
may wish is allowed to see a clergyman of his own particular
denomination. The Directors are required to visit the Penitentiary
at least twice in each month, and to report to the
Legislature biennially.</p>

<p class='c015'>A few words as to the County Prisons of Texas. The only
opportunity which offered for visiting a county jail was at Brenham,
Washington County. The jail building stands near the
court house, a little off from the public square, in the centre of
the town, and is without enclosure of any kind. It is a plain,
two story building, about twenty-five feet square, built of a
double thickness of hewed logs. A narrow corridor runs around
the inside of the lower story, and surrounds the dungeon, which
is the only room upon this story, and has walls of a triple thickness
of logs. The entrance to the dungeon is through a heavy
iron trap-door in the floor of the second story. The single door
of the jail itself opens directly from the street into the corridor.
The second story has but two apartments, which occupy its
entire extent; and one of these is appropriated for female
prisoners, when there are any. There was but one occupant, a
man, at the time of our visit. A short time previous, a prisoner
had been confined in the dungeon, awaiting his trial on a charge
of murder, but had succeeded in making his escape, in which he
must have had assistance from the outside. No jailer or other
officer lives at the jail, nor is any special watch kept. The
only furniture was a rude stool or two, and a few bed-clothes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>laid upon the bare floor. There are no windows in the building,
and a few narrow, horizontal openings in the log-walls,
secured with iron bars, afford the only supplies of light and
air; no shutters, sashes, or other means of closing these openings
are provided. There is no provision made for warming
the prison, and the cold must sometimes be severe, especially
during the prevalence of the Northers. The jail is in charge
of the Sheriff, and the food of the prisoners depends altogether
upon his discretion. It is possible, that in Galveston, and perhaps
in one or two other places, the County Prisons may be upon
a better plan, but in none of them is the separate system in
force. The prisoners, untried as well as convicts, have an
almost unrestrained intercourse. From all that we could learn,
it is to be feared that the jails of many of the Counties are even
less comfortable than the one at Brenham. But very many
things combine to render it peculiarly difficult to awaken the
public mind of Texas to the necessity and importance of a careful
consideration of the subject of Prison Discipline.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Art. III.</span>—CRIMINAL STATISTICS OF ENGLAND AND WALES FOR 1858.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>To the statesman and political economist, not less than to
the Christian philanthropist, an inquiry into the sources and
extent of crime, and the number, condition and previous history
of criminals cannot be without interest. Scarcely a day passes
in our chief cities, without the occurrence of some startling
outrage upon the public peace, or on the person or property of
the citizen. Scarcely a newspaper can be taken up, which
does not contain a record more or less in detail of acts of violence
and fraud. Why are they not prevented? What provokes
their perpetration? How are the guilty parties punished,
and what is the effect of their punishment on themselves or
others?</p>

<p class='c015'>In the absence (to our shame be it said) of reliable statistics
on such subjects in our own country, we are compelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>to resort to the elaborate and authentic reports made to the
British government. And as the vicious dispositions and passions
of men are the same there as here, and the temptations
to crime, as well as crimes themselves and the methods of perpetrating
them, do not materially differ in the two countries,
we find great satisfaction and instruction in the information
they furnish.</p>

<p class='c015'>In our last number we gave an abstract of the criminal
statistics of England and Wales for 1857. Since that time
we have received the more full and complete returns for
1858. We do not propose to notice the same class of items to
which our former article adverted, but to cull a few facts and
results of general and universal interest, which were not then
ascertained. The following table exhibits a significant class of
facts.</p>

<p class='c015'>The reader cannot fail to be impressed by the singular disproportion
in the number belonging to the criminal ranks, observed
on comparing these different groups of towns, classed
according to the predominant occupation or business of the inhabitants.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>There is no doubt that the incentives to a lawless
life are much more numerous and powerful at certain times and
places than at others. It would be easy to indicate probable
causes for such discrepancies, and to trace their connection
with particular phases of crime, but that is not relevant to
our present purpose.</p>

<p class='c015'>From the tabular view, it would seem that the criminal class is
highest in the great seats of hardware manufacture; next in
towns in rural districts; then in commercial ports; next in
pleasure towns; then in towns employed in small textile manufactures;
then in cotton manufacturing towns; next in woolen
manufacturing towns; and last in the metropolis. But in the
number of prostitutes the order is materially changed, the
largest proportion being in the commercial ports, and the
smallest in the woolen and worsted manufacturing towns,—the
metropolis being considerably below the average.</p>

<p class='c015'>There is a remarkable variation both in the general criminal
classes, and in the specific crime of prostitution in different
agricultural districts.</p>

<p class='c015'>The present returns show that only the very small proportion
of about one-fifth of the known criminal classes are in prison
at any one time.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of the parties proceeded against by indictment, nearly one-fourth
were of “previous good character;” and of those proceeded
against summarily, full one-half were of “previous good
character,” and of both classes fourteen per cent. of both sexes
were under sixteen!</p>

<p class='c015'>Considering that until very recently, at least 4000 of the
worst criminals were annually removed from the country by
transportation, and that though a much more efficient police
system has been in force, yet the number of commitments has
not been sensibly increased, the inference is drawn that a
better system of prevention prevails, and that better prison
management has led to the absorption of a large number of discharged
prisoners in honest employments.</p>

<p class='c015'>The greater prevalence of crime in the winter months is
accounted for on the ground that employment is more scarce,
and the prolonged hours of darkness afford greater opportunities
to commit it. It is obvious that the return of crimes
committed embraces but an inconsiderable portion of the overt
criminal acts in the community. During the period covered
by it, there were upwards of 40,000 known thieves and depredators,
and 40,000 suspected persons at large. The former
living by thieving must thieve to live, and it is “clear that a
large amount of petty depredations occur, which, with every
allowance for the large summary jurisdiction exercised in cases
of theft, is not represented in the return, as well as many continued
domestic thefts and frauds which are never detected, or
never brought within the cognizance of the police.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>There is an item in the present report which suggests some
inquiries that we should be inclined to pursue if we had
space and time. The common impression is, that men do not
<i>suddenly</i> leave the path of honesty and become rogues as it
were by a leap. There may be no overt act attracting the
notice or exciting the suspicion of the most intimate associates,
as a partner in business, a colleague in office, or a fellow workman
or clerk; but nevertheless subsequent revelations usually
show that the crooked path was entered cautiously, by reluctant
and hesitating steps, and some distance trod before there was
boldness enough to take the fatal step. We apprehend this
impression is warranted,—perhaps it is confirmed, rather than
weakened,—by the facts here disclosed. It is undoubtedly true
that delinquencies of a positive and unequivocal character are
often kept private, and the offending parties, after a brief interval,
betake themselves again to evil courses; and when some act
of gross turpitude is exposed, it is regarded as the first development
of a depraved character, whereas in fact it is only the last
of a long series of criminal acts. How far such concealment
is justifiable, or to what extent it is the means of saving persons
from an abandonment to a criminal life, we are not prepared
to say. But cases are not rare in which a desire to save
an individual from infamy, and perhaps a circle of friends from
mortification, has induced confidence to be reposed where it
was undeserved, and so has been the means of much deeper
injury to much higher interests. Very few instances occur in
which a grave offence is committed, especially against property,
by parties who had never before been known to swerve from
honesty.</p>

<p class='c015'>The present report shows, that of 30,458 persons, 5,398
were of previous good character, and 7,886 were known to be
of bad character. Out of 404,034 proceeded against summarily,
148,178 were of “previous good character,” and of
130,502 it was not known to be bad.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Report of Coroner’s inquests for the year gives a total
of 19,846, against 20,167 in 1857, and 22,221 in 1856. The
diminution is ascribed to the fact that in 1856 the rule was established
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>not to allow the expenses of inquests when it turned
out that the death ensued from natural causes, and without any
ground to suspect a criminal act or culpable neglect; and it is
also alleged, that police officers are not disposed to give notice of
cases that might properly fall under the Coroner’s investigation.
There is, certainly, a singular uniformity in the operation of
the causes that result in death by violence and accident. When
we think of the changes in the condition of society—the fluctuations
of business—and the excitements of passion, it seems
scarcely credible that so comparatively slight a variation should
occur in a succession of years; for example:—</p>

<p class='c015'>Only 1 difference in the murders of 1857 and 1858, only 10
in manslaughter, and only 17 in accidental deaths; and in suicides,
only 35 difference between 1856 and 1857.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is worthy of remark that, of the 19,846 inquests held,
5,517 were children seven years old or under, and 3,318 were
aged or infirm persons over sixty; showing that 44½ per cent.
were persons least able to protect themselves from accident or
injury. The average cost of each inquest was $15 dollars.</p>

<p class='c015'>The total number of convicts in custody during the year was
11,292, of whom 1,326 were women. Of the whole number,
110 died, 3 escaped, and only 36 were pardoned! The daily
average, for the year, was 7,859, and the annual cost of each
prisoner was $157.50, or about 42 cents per day. This sum is
subject to a reduction to the extent of the value of their labor.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Reformatory Schools have risen from 1 in 1854, to 47 in
1858; and the number of inmates, from 21 to 700. To these
schools, the government allows $1.75 per week, for each inmate;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and the Managers have authority to require a contribution
from the parents, when able. From the former source
$127,844 were received, and from parents $3,738; showing
the cost of each inmate, under these items alone, to be $187
per annum; and the Report has no allusion to their labor as of
any value. The average cost in any House of Refuge in the
United States, with which we are acquainted, does not much
exceed $100.</p>

<p class='c015'>There is now an extension of the system of Reformatory
Schools, which will doubtless prove of much value. The law
authorizes a provisional commitment, to certified industrial
schools, of children taken into custody on a charge of vagrancy,—after
due inquiry into the condition of their parents,
and of the circumstances of their arrest,—to be detained till
fifteen years of age, unless suitable provision is made for their
care and employment elsewhere. The present (1859) is the
first year of its operation.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is not easy even to approximate an estimate, in money, of
the cost to which crime subjects a community. Sixty years
ago, Colquhoun, in his work on the “Police of the Metropolis,”
estimated the loss by depredation, in London alone, at ten millions
of dollars; and the Watch-Committee of Liverpool, in an
elaborate report in 1836, stated the loss in that borough, by
depredation, at not less than three million five hundred thousand
dollars, declaring that this was not exaggerated, but, on
the contrary, much less than the actual amount. We suppose
that in such an estimate are included, not only the property
abstracted by theft and robbery, but also the fruits of the
various species of frauds on the government and on public
institutions, fraudulent bankruptcies, losses by incendiary fires,
and various kinds of malicious mischief.</p>

<p class='c015'>To the value of property sacrificed to crime, must be added
the expenses of police, prosecutions and prisons, amounting to
not less than twelve millions of dollars; and to these we must
add a large sum for a proportion of the salaries of judges and
justices, and their clerks; the maintenance of court-houses;
costs of coroners’ inquests; expenses of sheriffs; costs of prosecution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>by public bodies, and costs paid by private prosecutors
over and above the costs allowed; charges for convicts and
colonies, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c015'>We have a sound basis for an estimate sufficiently impressive.
There is a standing army of one hundred and thirty-five thousand
men and women, at war with the community, and living
on plunder and vice,—yesterday, engaged in depredations upon
property—to-day, rioting in reckless extravagance,—to-morrow,
reduced to pinching want. Supposing each of them to spend
one hundred and twenty-five dollars a year,—say two and a
half dollars a week, we have a sum total of nearly seventeen
millions—and this cannot be levied upon the public at less than
double that sum. This would amount to but a fraction less
than thirty-five millions of dollars, and, with the costs already
enumerated, would swell the grand total to very nearly fifty
millions, as the annual expense which the criminal classes of
England and Wales entail upon the community.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is to be regretted that we have no reliable data from which
to form even a probable estimate of either the number of criminals
or the cost of crime in any one of our States or cities, so
far as our information extends. If there were such, even in
one State or city, an inference, of more or less value, might be
drawn from a comparison of population, police force, &#38;c. We
can scarcely suppose that the incentives to crime are much
more numerous and powerful here than in England. It is not
found that crime abounds most in seasons of depression in business
or of reduction of wages or employment, but the contrary;
and therefore, the facilities with which people in our country
obtain a living may, perhaps, rather promote than prevent
crime. That we make much less of all crime here than is made
in the older countries, is very obvious; and that escape or impunity
is much more common here than there, will not be
denied: so that, on the whole, we may reasonably conclude
that if the tax imposed on the public, as the direct consequence
of crime, could be ascertained, its enormous amount
would awaken an interest in the means of preventing or suppressing
it, which the considerations of humanity and religion
seem inadequate to excite.</p>

</div>
<p class='c026'>THE TWENTY-SEVENTH REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE BRITISH
LADIES’ SOCIETY FOR PROMOTING THE REFORMATION OF
FEMALE PRISONERS, 1858.</p>

<p class='c027'>FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGERS OF THE
HOWARD INSTITUTION, 1858.</p>

<p class='c027'>FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE WOMEN’S PRISON ASSOCIATION
OF NEW YORK. “THE ISAAC T. HOPPER HOME,”
191 TENTH AVENUE, 1859.</p>

<p class='c014'>Although the number of female inmates of our Penitentiaries
is comparatively small, their reformation is not less an object of
interest. Certain it is, that efforts directed to them have been
crowned with a remarkable degree of success, in proportion to
their numbers. Prison returns show that it is much more rare
for a female to return, on a second conviction, than for a male;
and though a bad woman may be a much more revolting object
than an equally bad man, she must be very radically and
thoroughly degraded not to show more susceptibility of kind
and good influences than most male prisoners show. Whether
it is the world-wide fame of the late Mrs. Elizabeth Fry and
the stimulus of her bright example, that has drawn unusual
attention to the subject, or whether the wealth and leisure of
ladies of rank and distinction, has enabled them to devote more
attention and patronage to the reformation and restoration to
society, of women who have fallen under the condemnation of
penal law, we cannot say. But, certainly, the provision for
such unhappy persons is much more liberal, systematic and
extensive in the British Isles, than anything known among us.</p>

<p class='c015'>We have before us “the twenty-seventh (1858) report of the
Committee of the British Ladies’ Society for promoting the
reformation of female prisoners.” With the parent institution
there are connected ten county associations, besides five in
Scotland, and the report embraces notices, more or less extensive,
of the transactions of each of them. The central committee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>is subdivided into sub-committees, to each of which is assigned
the care of one of the seven principal prisons of the metropolis
in which female convicts are received.</p>

<p class='c015'>There is a distinct sub-committee, consisting of ten ladies
and two secretaries, known as the Patronage Committee. “It
sits on every Friday, and its especial duty is to attend to those
cases of discharged prisoners from metropolitan gaols which
are recommended to its care by the authorities of the prisons,
or by ladies who visit there. Endeavors are made to investigate
the previous history of each individual; and if there be
reason to believe that one is in earnest in the desire to reform,
measures are taken to assist her in so doing.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The rule of the Patronage Committee is, that the prisoner
appears before them immediately on her liberation, to comply
with which rule she often voluntarily stays back in the prison
till Friday. She brings with her, under the charge of a warder,
a certificate of health, and the written answers to a list of
printed questions.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sometimes a little temporary out-door relief meets the
necessity of the case, and occasionally an immediate return to
her family is deemed advisable; but in the large majority of
instances, these poor women are entirely unfit to be restored
to society at large without further probation. A refuge is needed
to give the opportunity of preparation for entering upon the
duties of a changed course of life. “The quiet discipline of
those institutions, the word of God there faithfully taught, the
encouraging influence of Christian ladies there met with, have
mercifully been blessed to the softening of many a hard heart,
and to the healing of many a broken spirit.”</p>

<p class='c015'>When it is believed that the penitence is sincere, and the
hope of restoration decided, the individual is sent direct to the
“Elizabeth Fry Refuge,” as a preliminary to other more
permanent asylums, or to await the future arrangements that
may appear most desirable for her. The funds of the “Elizabeth
Fry Refuge” permit fifteen of these patronage cases to
be kept in the house free of expense, as on the foundation; all
above that number are paid for by the British Ladies’ Society,
at the rate of $1.75 each, weekly.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Two hundred and sixty-four cases were disposed of by this
committee between June, 1856, and June, 1858.</p>

<p class='c015'>The report contains brief notices of the cases occurring at
the several prisons, and it is quite evident that the machinery
is well adapted to the purpose in view, and is eminently successful
in its workings.</p>

<p class='c015'>There can be no doubt of the softening and subduing influence
exerted upon the mind of a prisoner under almost any
circumstances, by the visit of an intelligent Christian friend.
However kind and sympathising the attending officers may be,
“the presence of some one connected with the outer world is
in itself a relief from the monotony of prison life. Thus the
prisoner is predisposed to listen kindly to words kindly spoken,
by one who voluntarily, for a time, shares her cell, and reads
the only book which reveals authoritatively the terms of acceptance
on which both must rely for pardon and salvation.”</p>

<p class='c015'>To those who are disposed to serve in the self-denying and
often discouraging work of prison-visiting, it may not be amiss
to suggest that the prompt attention to each new case is very
important. An influence for good may be acquired, which will,
perhaps, give a new direction to the conduct of the prisoner
for the full time of penal servitude. The voice of kindness
and sympathy heard when the offender <i>first</i> realizes the consequences
of his course, may be more efficacious than at any subsequent
period.</p>

<p class='c015'>There is a public institution, corresponding in its principal
features to the houses of reception to which we have referred.
It is the Government “Refuge” at Fulham. Prisoners who
have conducted themselves well at Millbank and Brixton, and
who are likely to profit by more individual attention than they
can receive at either of those prisons, are, during the concluding
period of their imprisonment, placed in the Government
‘Refuge’ at Fulham. Being selected with a view to their being
placed in service, or being provided with some means of obtaining
an honest livelihood after they are liberated, they are instructed
in laundry and household work of every kind; and
every means employed in the best Reformatories are here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>afforded, with the encouragement of knowing that, while they
behave well, the penal character of this last stage of imprisonment
is merged in the enjoyment of all the spiritual and temporal
privileges which they could meet with in an asylum for
the free. We are enabled to state, on the best authority, that,
out of eighty cases which had left the Fulham Refuge in the
month of April last, sixty were doing well.</p>

<p class='c015'>Among the country institutions, having in view the welfare
of discharged female prisoners, and not under the control of a
Government or Magistrates, is a refuge at Bristol, “where the
hopeful discharged female prisoner (above sixteen years of age)
enters <i>direct</i> from prison by her own free will, and under a
promise to submit to the rules of the house. <i>She undergoes a
probation of three weeks or a month in her dormitory</i>, during
which time she is daily visited by one or more ladies, who thus
obtain a moral influence before the probationer is admitted to
hold free intercourse with her future companions.” Thus prepared,
the inmates are afterwards trained to all sorts of household
employment. Daily religious instruction is given, and
the singing of psalms and hymns practised; they are also
taught reading and writing, and the first elements of arithmetic
and geography; knitting, also, that very useful branch of female
industry, is introduced. Ten young women have been provided
during the year with respectable situations, and not one of them
has again been accused of dishonesty. It is mentioned as an
evidence of the genuineness of reform, that a small gold brooch,
found by one of the inmates, while clearing a room, was given
up, and, after many inquiries for the owner, was restored to a
lady who had visited the asylum; also, that a £5 note, folded
very small, was found by the youngest inmate; this, also, was
immediately given up, and restored to the owner, a few hours
afterwards.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the report of the Exeter Refuge allusion is made to the
fact, that the introduction of the <span class='sc'>Separate System</span> into the
prison there, has reduced the number of prisoners greatly.
Of 199 discharged female prisoners received, fifteen are now
under care, and a good account is given of 104 who have left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>it. We cannot but regard such a measure of success as most
encouraging. That much of this success is owing to the individual
separation of the convicts cannot be doubted. Indeed,
the visitors to the Falmouth Prison emphatically condemn it
for the absence of that principle. “With regard to our
prison I can say nothing encouraging; there is no change
with regard to its arrangements. Some of those who are
interested for the poor people immured within its walls,
do what they can to keep the necessity of improvement
before the public, and there are two who visit regularly, as
they may find it convenient, but I fear they can say nothing
with regard to the effect produced. We feel that we must keep
in view the injunction, ‘In the morning sow thy seed,’ &#38;c.
Could solitary (separate) confinement be but partially carried
out, the case would be more encouraging; and we shall be
most glad to have such a prison as would allow of our making
trial of it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>And in respect to the Gloucester Prison, a lady who has
visited it regularly, says: “City convicts are received by the
county; but prisoners before trial, summary convictions and
prostitutes all herd together in one common ward and yard by
day, and one large room by night, both rooms being out of
sight and hearing of the Matron. I believe that I have mentioned
this often to you; but it is so great an evil, and so dangerous
to the comparatively innocent, that I cannot but advert
to it again.”</p>

<p class='c015'>In the city of Utrecht a new prison, on the Cellularian or
separate plan, has been erected, and a Ladies’ Committee,
formed, like the one in London; and the government of Holland
has expressed a wish that near every prison such a Society
be established, with full permission to visit the prisoners. In
Stockholm, also, is a Ladies’ Committee. “There is not a
female prisoner in Stockholm who is not visited once in the
week, or who has not at least the opportunity of hearing the
word of God explained to her in one of the departments of the
large house for penal servitude, where their attendance on
Sunday is voluntary.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The readers of our Journal are aware that in Philadelphia
and New York, and perhaps in other cities of the United States,
similar organizations have existed for many years. Among
them is the “Howard Institution,” under the care of an Association
of Women-Friends of Philadelphia, the object of which
is, “the care and reformation of female prisoners, who, after a
term of imprisonment, manifest a disposition to reform; or
others who, on account of their evil habits, need Christian
counsel, moral restraint and domestic discipline. To accomplish
this, a home is provided to shelter them from evil associations;
to surround them with wholesome moral and religious
influences; to inculcate good principles, and habits of
neatness and industry; to instruct them in domestic duties, so
as to qualify them for usefulness; and after a term of probation,
to obtain for them respectable situations in town or country.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The Fourth Annual Report of the Institution (whose house
of reception is 1612 Poplar Street) shows, that during the year
fifty women have been admitted, and remained under care from
one week to several months. The necessity of some such provision
for this class of our fellow-citizens is not exaggerated.
“However trivial may have been the crime of which the prisoner
was convicted, (and that many are convicted of <i>very slight</i> offences,
there is no doubt); however well she may have conducted
during her incarceration, the <i>name</i> and <i>stigma</i> of <i>convict</i> is upon
her. Often she is without home or friends, with insufficient
clothing, hungry and penniless. If she <i>had friends</i>, they are
alienated from her; it may have been years that she has been
separated from them—they have forgotten her. <i>None</i> will
receive her into their houses. None will give her employment.
What can she do? Perhaps the sparks of virtue are <i>not yet</i>
extinguished. In the solitude of her prison cell she may have
formed good resolutions; there may be an earnest struggle in
her soul after a better life; but she is weak. The tempter
comes in; cold and hunger and neglect, drive her to despair
and crime. Her desires for reformation are lost among evil
associations; and she sinks deeper into the gulf of depravity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and wretchedness. Who will say that humanity is doing its
duty to these poor outcasts?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The report before us affords gratifying evidence that endeavors
to rescue and restore to respectability and usefulness those
unhappy women are not misplaced. “In a <i>majority</i> of cases
the Institution has been a blessing to those who have been subject
to its discipline.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The Fourteenth Annual Report of the Women’s Prison
Association of New York, concerns a charity hereafter to be
known as “The Isaac T. Hopper Home,” and it brings to view
some interesting facts, and presents strong claims to generous
assistance. The institution has been for several years independent
of the New York Prison Association. Its object is to ameliorate
the condition of female prisoners, improve the discipline
and government of prisons so far as females are concerned, and
to give temporary support and encouragement to reformed female
convicts. To give system and efficiency to their laudable
efforts, they earnestly desired help in erecting a building
adapted to that purpose, and at one time had flattering prospects
of success. They had reasonable ground to believe, that
with suitable accommodations, they might make the home a
self-sustaining house of industry; but their expectations were
not realized, and as the only alternative they purchased and put
in repair the house they have long occupied.</p>

<p class='c015'>We have often adverted to the lessons which a sound
economy reads to us on the subject of caring for discharged
prisoners. When it is considered what immeasurable injury a
single evil-disposed person may do, and what expenses mere
vagrants or petty thieves, to say nothing of forgers and
counterfeiters, impose on the community, it cannot be regarded
as a matter of trivial moment whether an enemy of society is
transformed into a friend, and a burden into a help. Hence
the managers of the Society repudiate the idea that they are
beggars, and claim to be instruments of a true economy.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The subjects of our care” (say they) “are costly dependents
of the City’s Treasury. They not only are fed, clothed,
and housed by the city, but their crimes waste the property of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>our citizens, and their misfortunes swell their taxes. Who are
the inmates of our Home? A few young women may occasionally
be found there—strangers in the country, wanderers
from their natural homes, who, alone and friendless in this
great city, have fallen, not from vicious propensities, but
through sheer misfortune; and a few there are whom we have
also found in your prisons, the victims of wrong suspicion and
helplessness. All these, after a short novitiate, we have
restored to decent life, and productive industry. But for our
interposition, they must have remained, with hardly an exception,
your costly pensioners. Some of our inmates are from
Sing-Sing—convicts, who have been sent there for the lighter
class of crimes so punishable; but by far the greater part are
from the Tombs—Blackwell’s Island—persons committed for
petty offences, or merely for vagrancy. These are the victims
of intemperance. They are led astray at first by the social
element of the Irish, by an inherited appetite, by bad company,
by the thousand influences and temptations that beset
the ignorant and neglected, by the brutal treatment and
desertion of husbands, by wrong, disappointment, and despair.
These offenders are tried in the Municipal Courts, and sent for
weeks, or months, as the case may be, to Blackwell’s Island.
At the end of their ‘term’ they return to the city homeless
and friendless: a few hours, days, or weeks at farthest, find
them again making the same circuit through commitment, trial,
and ‘term’ on ‘the Island’—and all at the expense of the
sober, hard-working citizen, who, if he takes time to look at
the matter, will be somewhat startled to find how much he has
to pay to the police, the justices, the prison officials of all
degrees, from the head superintendent to the driver of the
‘Black Maria,’ and the expensive <i>lodging houses</i> of Blackwell’s
Island.” And again, “all we do, is a clear saving to the city.
We do not count merely the time that our inmates are sustained
at the Home, for—though they are supported by the
public, by their charities, instead of their taxes, yet two thirds
of those received at the Home during the last year, have been
sent to places: not only has the public been relieved from their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>support, but they have become productive laborers. We would
make no erroneous impressions. These people do not all
remain steadfast. They are, for the most part, adult children,
liable to go astray at any strong temptation or impulse, or to
fall back under the despotism of old habits. They require to
be watched and trained, kindly guided and cared for; and they
do not <i>always</i> find religious zeal, patience, skill, and tender
forbearance in their employers. Still, under all their inevitable
disadvantages, many of our inmates have persevered
steadfastly in a good life, proving to the most sceptical, that
with God’s blessing on the helping-hand, they can be saved.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The facts are very stubborn. Here are one hundred and
twenty-five women, addicted for the most part to degrading
and infamous vices—living in vagrancy, dishonesty, drunkenness
and prostitution; and a large proportion of them familiar
with the corruption and degradation of prison life. Somebody
must look after them, and none but practical, zealous, working
women, who will give themselves to such a task—not for a visit
or two, nor for a few days or weeks, but for months, and perhaps,
for years—seeking out, watching over, encouraging and
guiding those who are susceptible of improvement, if not of
radical reform.</p>

<p class='c015'>A few such are found, and the one hundred and twenty-five
outcasts are gathered to “The Isaac T. Hopper Home.”
There are some interesting cases among them, and they are all
objects of interest; but, says one, “Do you really expect to
do any permanent good to such people?” And another exclaims,
“How disgusting it must be!” And a third, “How
very disagreeable to go to such horrible places! How much
better and wiser to drop a twenty or a fifty dollar bank note
to the board of managers, or the matron, saying, You have
hard materials to make up. Here is an expression of my
sympathy. The friend of the friendless bless and prosper
you.” But what has become of the one hundred and twenty-five
inmates received during the year? Why, seventy of them
were sent to service, and generally in the country. Of course
they are not burdens to the public treasury while in this position,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>nor are they plundering houses and stores, nor provoking
home brawls and street fights. This is no little saving all
around. They not only cease to be burdens; they have been
converted into producers; one has twenty, another fifty, and
another seventy dollars reserved from earned wages. The
cleansing, tidying, training, encouraging and aiding received
at the Home, have fitted them for, and introduced them to,
respectable and useful occupations. What sum shall we set
against this as the probable amount of expense in arrests,
prosecutions, sustenance, gaol fees, &#38;c., had they been suffered
to pursue their chosen way.</p>

<p class='c015'>But some are discharged, and others leave, and ere long
find their old lodgings in the Tombs or on the “Island.” Yes,
that is so, but mark this! “They almost invariably appeal to
us again for aid, and receive it, ☞ and <i>each time the period
of their perseverance in good is prolonged</i>.” This is hopeful.
It invites us to patience and faith. A single peach or pear on
a favorite tree, or a single bunch of grapes on a choice vine,
during the first bearing season, gives more pleasure than a peck
of fruit in any subsequent year. The field which these benevolent
ladies and their sisters of charity in our own city and the
British metropolis, are called to cultivate, is covered with a
luxurious growth of wild and poisonous plants, in every stage
of growth and bearing. Their labor and skill, with the aid of
the Divine husbandman, is devoted to an insertion here and
there as opportunity offers, of a graft from a better stock. If
it “takes,” they are encouraged to hope for fruit in due time;
and though disappointments are not rare, success is frequent
enough to animate and encourage them, and shall ensure them
the hearty sympathy and generous aid of those whose taxes are
lightened, whose property is saved from depredation, indirectly
at least by their instrumentality.</p>

<p class='c015'>The house occupied by the “Howard Institution” is perhaps
as convenient as any one that is not originally designed for
such a purpose; but it does not afford such opportunities of
<i>individualizing</i> the treatment as would be desirable. The New
York premises are probably no better in this respect.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>We cannot refrain from expressing the conviction that the
more rigidly persons who have been convicted of crime can be
separated one from another, until their resolutions to lead an
amended life are fully confirmed and well tested, the less the
danger of a relapse. We are aware of the argument sometimes
used, viz.: That these principles cannot be tested till the parties
are exposed to temptation. But there are temptations
enough in the ordinary circumstances of life. If a young
woman, discharged from the penitentiary, and received into
some “Home” or “Refuge,” should be kept from all association
with those who have been in like condemnation, until she
is prepared for, and provided with, some place in the country,
the first day in her new position would present temptations
enough to test her newly acquired strength. Industry, honesty,
truthfulness and sobriety are every day virtues. If they are
possessed they will show themselves without urging, but while
under any degree of restraint or inspection these virtues may
be counterfeited. It is not needful to put them into the company
of a vagrant, a thief, a liar or a drunkard to bring them
out. On the contrary, our true policy is to keep them as far
apart as possible, and especially when the virtues are struggling
to supplant the vices.</p>

<p class='c015'>Let our penitentiaries and county gaols provide for strict
individual separation, accommodation and employment of all
prisoners, of every grade, tried and untried. Let kind, judicious,
intelligent friends visit them, express proper sympathy
with them, and hold out encouragement to them. Upon their
discharge, let there be found a place of temporary refuge where
they can be comfortably provided for, relieved from the pressure
of immediate temptation, exempted from any associations
unfriendly to their permanent reform, and prepared by a reasonable
probation for some employment. The moment this is
accomplished, and some benevolent heart is opened to give the
party an opportunity to retrieve a forfeited place in the confidence
of the community, let it be embraced with a continuance
of the watchful care which may be still needed in unforeseen
emergencies.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>With these precautions and aids we are confident thousands
of our convicts might be rescued from reckless criminality or
hopeless despair, and some of the most prolific sources of crime
be dried up. The government is bound, by every consideration
of public policy, to aid liberally in restoring to honest and
virtuous ways those who have been subjected to penal suffering,
and who are disposed to amend their lives. Its functions do
not begin nor end in arrests, convictions and sentences. It is
to employ all practicable means of keeping people out of crime,
by encouraging and sustaining schools—literary, industrial and
reformatory, and bringing ALL the children and youth of the
country under their influence. And when, in spite of all these
wholesome provisions, men and women do betake themselves to
criminal courses, and have suffered the just reward of their deeds,
it is the duty of the government not to leave them, at the expiration
of their sentence, to shift for themselves, but to hold
out a kind hand to them, if they are inclined to better ways,
and assist them to regain a creditable position among their fellow
men. Society has the worst of it if they relapse into their
previous associations and practices. And hence, we earnestly
plead for the support and encouragement, by public and private
liberality, of every sensible scheme to convert a convict into
an honest man—an enemy of society into a friend and helper.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Art. V.—IRISH CONVICT PRISONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The intermediate system of discipline adopted in the convict
prisons of Ireland, to which we have called the attention of our
readers in previous numbers of this Journal, seems to gain
favor. The simple principle on which it is founded is the
gradual improvement of those prisoners who are susceptible of
reforming influences, until they are prepared for entire freedom,
and the return to and continuance in confinement of those
who are obstinately bent on pursuing a criminal career. The
system is so arranged as to give the convict the control, in a
great measure, of his own position. If he is disposed to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>well, every reasonable aid is afforded him for the purpose. If
his vicious habits are so confirmed as to forbid the hope of his
permanent reformation, society is protected from his hostility,
by his retention, indefinitely, in prison. In the first place, the
prisoner must conform to certain rules, while confined in the
ordinary prison, to entitle himself to the privileges of the
intermediate prisons. Any misconduct at this stage, will
have the effect of postponing his admission into the intermediate
prison, and thereby defer, to an equal extent, the remission of
a portion of his sentence. The following table shows, at a
glance, what inducement the prisoner has to co-operate with
the government in his reformation:</p>

<p class='c015'>It will be seen that, by this scale, a three years’ sentence is
reduced to two and a half; four years to three and a fourth;
five years to four; six years to four and a half; seven years
to five and a fourth; eight years to six and three-fourths; ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>years to seven and a half; twelve years to nine, and fifteen
years to ten.</p>

<p class='c015'>In order to ensure the remission of any part of his sentence,
the prisoner must work himself, by good behaviour, into the
intermediate prison, through which he must pass to obtain his
final liberty; and this liberty, when obtained, will be conditional;
for the criminal who, after his discharge, consorts with
bad companions, and shows that he meditates a return to criminal
courses, is liable to be re-arrested and re-consigned to the
prison from which he was (as it appears) prematurely discharged.
Thus society is protected, on one hand, from the existence of
hordes of criminally-disposed persons at large, and the discharged
convict is restrained from renewed transgression by
surrounding the further commission of crime with obstructions
so formidable as to disband, in a great measure, the class of
“habitual offenders.”</p>

<p class='c015'>It will be observed that the remission of any part of the
sentence is not a matter of <i>compact</i> between the government
and the prisoner. It is a gratuitous act, and as such, may be
restrained or modified, to suit individual cases. When crimes
are of so heinous a character as to forbid the extension of any
such leniency, they will, of course, be specially dealt with by
the government.</p>

<p class='c015'>With a uniform constabulary system, embracing the whole
country, and a uniform penal code, we might expect here a more
perfect system of prison discipline than in any other country;
but there is much complaint of the inequality of sentences for
the same crimes, and of the too great leniency shown to
“habitual offenders.” These, it is maintained, should be
recognized by the law as a distinct class, as they are by the
police. The practice of lengthening the sentence of an
offender because of previous convictions, is regarded with favor,
and its observance should be systematized and made universal.
In this way “conditional pardons and registrations
for the remitted term may be made the means of causing the very
general incarceration of ‘habitual offenders’ in the only place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>suitable for them—convict prisons—with sentences of sufficient
length to insure their being properly dealt with.”</p>

<p class='c015'>An important principle is involved in this probationary system.
If a man deliberately commits an offence against public law, the
presumption is that he will repeat it whenever the occasion and
temptation are presented. The privation and suffering which the
execution of his sentence imposes, may deter him from farther
transgression, but the burden of proving this is on the offender.
The first duty of society is to protect itself. When the period
of penal restraint expires, the man is discharged, on the presumption
that he will sin no more. Whatever measures we can
adopt to strengthen this presumption, and to assure society that
he may be safely set at liberty, are as salutary for him as for
us. And there is a farther obligation, and a very imperative
one, on the part of the government, and that is to <i>strengthen and
encourage purposes of amendment</i>. If the liberated convict finds
it difficult to procure labor where his antecedents are known, he
has the option of going to countries where labor is more in demand;
and the means of reaching those countries are supplied by
his prison gratuity, obtained through his own industry. In many
of our schemes for ameliorating the miseries of public prisons,
the interests of society are too often overlooked, and the
comfort and ease of a transgressor unduly sought. There is a
medium. The community whose laws have been outraged,
justly demands the prompt and certain imposition of the
penalty. If this can be imposed in such a way as at once to
express the due disapprobation of the act, and a desire that the
offender may be restored (on his reformation) to his forfeited
place in society, a double advantage is gained.</p>

<p class='c015'>As more enlightened methods of dealing with the criminally-disposed
prevail, we have a right to look for a more efficient
and well-balanced administration of penal law, and as a consequence,
a sensible diminution in the number of crimes and
criminals.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'><span class='blackletter'>Brief Notices.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Escapes and Pardons.</span>—The two chief ends which are usually supposed
to be answered by punishment are,—1. To reform the offender;
and, 2. To deter others from the like offences. Some persons deny the
legitimacy of the latter purpose, affirming that society has no right to
inflict pains and penalties on me, for the benefit of my neighbors. Without
attempting to settle any such nice points, we have a plain, palpable
fact staring us in the face, which seems, in a large measure, to frustrate
both the ends to which we have referred. That fact is—that the punishment
of crime, in our country, is one of the most uncertain events with
which we are conversant. If a horse-thief, contemplating the fastenings
of a stable-door, should have fore-thought enough to inquire whether there
is such a reasonable probability of his punishment as should deter him
from his purpose, we can scarcely suppose he would come to an affirmative
conclusion. The contingencies on which the result depends are very
numerous and complicated. If his picture is in the rogue’s gallery; or
if he is an old, well-known horse-thief, so that suspicion would naturally
fasten upon him if he was within fifty miles of the <i><span lang="la">locus in quo</span></i> at the
time; or if a reward is offered for his arrest, more tempting than what
he can offer for leave to run,—it may be his turn to be caught. But if
he has money, or friends who understand the “intricacies” of the administration
of penal law in some of our chief cities; or if he has had
opportunities, in some associate prison, to learn how to dodge an officer,
either before or after sentence, or to earn his liberty, even when fairly
caged, either by working through bricks and mortar, or through the more
porous and yielding tissue of a Governor’s sympathy,—he has little or
nothing to fear. If there is no more risk than that, the State is certain
to be plundered.</p>

<p class='c015'>We hazard nothing in saying that the influence which the punishment
of crime exerts, in deterring the criminally disposed from committing it,
is scarcely worth a padlock. A single escape of a prisoner from gaol, or
from the custody of an officer, weakens whatever deterring influence is
exerted over hundreds of minds; and so likewise does a single pardon.
Each one of the hundreds betakes himself to a criminal life, expecting
to be the favored rogue. We sometimes think, with a sigh, of the good
time past, when, under English law, the constable was the chief man in
the parish, and when the parish was responsible for all robberies committed
within its limits, if the thieves were not apprehended.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>If we had a general, succinct return of the escapes and pardons in the
United States, for a single year, it would show a degree of looseness in
the administration of criminal law, and of imprudence in the exercise of
executive clemency, of which the public have little conception.</p>

<p class='c015'>From a great number of cases which go to corroborate the statement
we have made, we have room for but a few, and these will serve to indicate
the character of all. We give them as reported in the newspapers:</p>

<p class='c015'>On a late Saturday night five prisoners escaped from the gaol of Cook
county, Ill., at Chicago. A paltry reward of $150 was offered for their
apprehension. The prisoners were supplied with tools by their friends
outside. They were arrested for larceny. Three other prisoners,
charged with robbery, were engaged in digging a hole through the floor,
when the escape of the others caused them to be detected. The prison
is in a very insecure sort of place, and had been grossly neglected by the
authorities.</p>

<p class='c015'>In Blair county, on the same Saturday night, a man, alleged to have
stolen several horses, and who escaped from the person having him in
charge, while on their way to Bedford recently, was re-arrested at a private
house on Bobb’s Creek, on Saturday night a week. Assuming a
religious guise, previous to retiring he called for a Bible, and read a
chapter, and prayed with the family. When arrested he was in bed, with
a six-shooter under his pillow, and every barrel charged with a bullet!
and in his pockets were found several counterfeit notes and a small
amount of good money. A reward of $500 had been offered for his
arrest, with the horses.</p>

<p class='c015'>Two prisoners escaped from the gaol of Clinton county, Ohio, under
circumstances (says the Clinton Watchman) that would indicate a good
deal of carelessness on the part of the sheriff, who had charge of the
gaol. They escaped by cutting a hole through the floor of the hall around
the cells, where the prisoners are permitted to stay during the day. After
cutting this hole, which they did with an old case-knife, they crawled
under, and finding there an old scaffold-pole, they made a battering-ram
of it, and punched a stone out of the outside wall sufficiently large to
permit their egress!</p>

<p class='c015'>About a year ago, Norristown, in this vicinity, was harassed by the
operations of a burglar of special daring and adroitness, who, after perpetrating
a series of successful burglaries, was arrested, and imprisoned
under a sentence of fifteen years. He had served about a year thus far,
and on a late morning was found to have successfully broken gaol and
made his escape.</p>

<p class='c015'>He got away, it is supposed, about four o’clock in the morning. His
cell was in the upper story of the gaol, and had an arched roof of solid
masonry, nine inches thick. When the turnkey entered the cell, it
was discovered that the prisoner had cut entirely through this arch,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>and then through the sheet-iron roof above it, and had lowered himself
by means of a cord made of the carpet-warp furnished him for
working purposes. The escape was perilous in the extreme; while it is
the opinion of experts that the preparations for it have been going on for
a long time. Upon entering the cell the officer discovered an old shirt,
which the prisoner appears to have stuffed in the hole during the daytime,
while it is equally apparent that, by means of pieces of bread manipulated
to the consistency of putty, and plastered into the edges of the
hole, the discovery of the cheat was rendered still less probable. As a
matter of course, the anxiety to recover such a prisoner, on the part of
the sheriff, is very great; and a reward of a hundred dollars is offered for
his capture! Due anxiety to <i>keep</i> him when they had him would have
been more creditable to the officers, and much better for the public.</p>

<p class='c015'>On the second of December, six convicts employed in the moulding
shop of the New York State Prison, at Auburn, effected their escape. The
prisoners had got half a mile from the prison before pursuit was commenced,
and succeeded in leaving their pursuers behind.</p>

<p class='c015'>On the evening of December 15th, two convicts, confined in a Virginia
gaol, under sentence of death, to be executed the next day, escaped from
the gaol, and were fired upon by the sentinels and driven back to prison.
The prisoners had mounted the gaol wall when they were discovered by
the sentinel on the outside, who immediately gave the alarm and fired
on them. They had sawed their manacles asunder with the blade of a
Barlow knife, which they had concealed and made into a fine saw. It
was ascertained, from their confession that they had been engaged in preparing
for their escape during the preceding ten days. They made a hole
in the wall near the window, which they concealed with paper, hiding the
bricks they removed under the bed. Upon the alarm being given, they
made no resistance, but surrendered as soon as they discovered, by the
shot of the sentinel, that they were detected. One of them said he could
have made his escape had he jumped down and throttled the sentinel.</p>

<p class='c015'>All the inmates of Warren county (Pa.) prison, two women and two
men, escaped one night recently. The women up stairs burnt the clasp
out that fastened the door through a single pine board,—came down
stairs and unlocked the cells in which the men were confined, by means
of false keys, when the party departed in peace, taking a wagon that was
waiting in the vicinity, with them.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thirteen prisoners escaped from Munroe county gaol, at Rochester,
N. Y. They seized the gaoler and wrenched the keys from him,—then
thrust him into a closet with double doors, fastening them outside. The
gaoler’s wife was in the office, but heard nothing of the disturbance until
the whole gang were at the door, demanding an outlet, which it was in
vain for her to oppose.</p>

<p class='c015'>Two prisoners, burglars and counterfeiters, on the way to the Jackson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>penitentiary (Mich.), guarded by three officers, jumped from the cars
while under way. They were heavily ironed, and pretended to be asleep.
As they approached Grass Lake station, the sheriff, who sat in front,
stepped back to look out of a window, when they rushed to the door, and
their irons mysteriously parted, and one jumped one side, and
the other, leaving the officers in gaping wonder.</p>

<p class='c015'>A man, whose crime (forgery) was of such a heinous character as to
induce the government of Wurtemberg to pursue him to this country,
was found and arrested. After a partial examination, instead of being
remanded to prison or held to responsible bail, he was allowed to remain
at his own lodgings, being in the <i>constructive custody</i> of the Deputy Marshal.
This functionary, instead of producing his prisoner when wanted,
stated to the commissioner that, on a preceding evening, the foreign rogue
invited him to take a friendly glass, which he accepted, and soon after
lost his consciousness; and the prisoner, availing himself of so favorable
an opportunity, took to his heels and, before the officer recovered his wits,
was beyond recapture.</p>

<p class='c015'>So it was with one Dr. Gallaudet, not long ago, who succeeded in
getting the officer drunk, and escaped from his clutches, and, finally, from
the country.</p>

<p class='c015'>These cases do not constitute a tenth part of the advertised escapes of
a single quarter; and those that are never brought to public notice—who
knows their number?</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Early Crime.</span>—Few persons are aware of the extent of juvenile crime
in our principal cities. A large majority of these offences are overlooked
until they become so serious in their consequences to private interest
as to command attention. And even then, the prosecution of the offence
is generally waived if compensation is made, or if the delinquent is sent
away upon a voyage, or to a distant part of the country.</p>

<p class='c015'>We have grouped together a few items out of many scores which a
single quarter furnishes, from which our readers can make their own inferences.
They confirm us in the conviction long entertained, that we
need a place of <i>punishment</i> for those who are too old in iniquity to be safe
inmates of Refuge or Reformatory, and too young to endure the severity
of rigid penitentiary discipline—a <i>juvenile separate prison</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'>A gang of boys, none over fourteen, were arrested, a few days since, in
Cincinnati, for stealing. They were detected in the act of taking goods
from store doors. They stated that they belonged to a gang of boys employed
in this business by a man who gave them 75 cents for every article
they would bring him, and that they used the money in visiting the
theatres and in refreshments. An officer took one of them to the National
Theatre, where he pointed out two more of the gang, who were taken into
custody. On visiting the premises of the man whom they charged with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>receiving the goods, they found some of them concealed under the floor.
There was also another place of deposit disclosed in another section of
the city. The boys, who were all of Irish parentage, exhibited the utmost
indifference and shamelessness, and the parents of two of them did not
feel interest enough to attend the hearing!</p>

<p class='c015'>The Boston papers give us an account of a similar band of boys who
had clubbed together for thieving purposes, in Medford, a few miles from
that city. They were discovered in an outbuilding which had not been
used for some time. Various articles, such as portemonnaies, wallets,
passbooks, pencils, &#38;c., were found in their possession, and identified as
having been stolen the day before. A book was found among them, containing
the names of the members of the organization, about half a dozen
in number, as far as recorded. Following the names was the word
“Rules,” in large letters. The only rule which appears, was the following:</p>

<p class='c015'>“1. The boys must steal as much as they can, and present it to the
chief.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The book also contained a number of passwords, and a list of the articles
stolen, above enumerated, and the date. The boys belonging to this
young thieves’ association are from ten to fourteen years of age.</p>

<p class='c015'>At Cleveland, Ohio, a party of juvenile vagrants, some twelve in number,
recently organized themselves into a society for the purpose of robbery,
dock-thieving, &#38;c. They took possession of a large cave in the
side-hill on the west side of the river. They chose their captain and were
progressing very smoothly when the officer pounced upon them. They were
all sleeping in bunks, with the exception of the guard, who took to his
heels on the approach of the officer. Two or three others made their escape.
The following boys, the oldest of whom is not over fourteen, were
arrested:—John Fitzgerald, Thomas Doland, Michael Dunn, William
Mulcoge, Patrick M‘Donald, William Donald, William Shay and James
Mahon. Their names are given as indicative of a nativity not otherwise
to be particularly specified.</p>

<p class='c015'>One of the boys is only six years old. He said his parents, in a fit of
drunkenness, kicked him out of doors. The other boys said that they had
no home or friends. They could only live by stealing, and on advice of
one of their number, who had read Mike Martin and other yellow covered
books of that sort, a band of robbers was formed, and the cave taken
possession of. The boys were sent to the State Reform Farm, there to
remain until discharged by law. [Of this school we have given a full
account in a former number, and would be glad to hear of its more recent
success.]</p>

<p class='c015'>Not long since, in New York, a policeman, about 11 o’clock at night,
was surprised to find the front door of a jewelry store, in Broadway,
unlocked, and on entering he found a boy named Joseph Bascom,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>seventeen years of age, employed by the firm, tied down upon a bed and
gagged. After being released, the boy said that about ten o’clock, shortly
after the store was closed, he heard a rap at the door, and supposing
that one of the clerks had returned for something, opened it, when three
men rushed in, one of whom threw a large sheet over his face, while the
other two grasped him by the throat, and after gagging him, took him to
the bed and fastened him there, his head all the time being covered. After
this he heard them open the safe, and in a short time they left. The
officer doubted this plausible story, and subjected him to a severe cross-questioning,
which resulted in Bascom confessing that the whole affair
was contrived by himself and another lad named Primrose! They obtained
an impression of the safe key, and selected the time when the holiday
stock was in store for the commission of the robbery. Bascom
admitted his accomplice after the store was closed, and then laid down
upon the bed and was gagged and tied by him. Their plan was a success,
and $15,000 worth of goods were taken from the safe. The police were
soon on the track of Primrose, whom they followed to the establishment
of a well known receiver of stolen goods named Schwartzwelder, who,
with Primrose, was arrested. On searching the place all the stolen goods
were recovered.</p>

<p class='c015'>Ought a criminal of this stamp to be sent to a reformatory school? Is
he to be regarded as no more depraved and desperate than a truant, or
an insubordinate child? If <i>he</i> is sent there, should <i>they</i> be?</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Compromising with Rogues</span>—In a former number of this Journal, we
entered somewhat at large into the mischievous consequences of concealing
or winking at, or compromising deliberate, overt, criminal acts. A
clerk in a store abuses his master’s confidence, by abstracting money from
letters or purloining letters containing remittances—he being entrusted
with the duties of mail clerk. The fraud has been practiced for weeks,
and the adroitness with which it was perpetrated and the ingenuity
displayed in concealing the disposition of the funds, evinces a singularly
depraved disposition. The father or friends interpose, and a public
prosecution is avoided. The young scape-grace is sent from the country,
and having unusual shrewdness and audacity, succeeds in winning
confidence. He writes home and tells of his good fortune, and hope is
excited that his ways are reformed; but soon a bolder and deeper game
of villainy is played, and the scene again changes, but with the same
result. At last, however, he is brought to the bar of public justice, and
now a revelation is made of the successive steps in his downward path.
Each of the delinquencies has its witnesses and victims; but silence has
been volunteered, or purchased, or imposed, and so the reckless career has
been encouraged. This is not a fictitious case and it may serve to introduce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>an illustration of this misconceived leniency which has lately been made
public. A man of glib tongue and imposing appearance, professes to be
a physician. He takes up his residence in one of our suburban districts,
and, in process of time, is guilty of gross malpractice. To avoid an exposure
of his ignorance and cruelty, he pays the injured parties
$1200 and removes to another part of the country. There he defrauds
a bank of $1,000, but the evidence is not absolutely conclusive,
and upon his refunding the amount the bank forbears to prosecute. By-and-by
he is arrested for a felonious assault on a female patient, (the wife
of a college student who wishes to conceal the fact of his marriage,) and
so the offence is hushed up. Next he marries the widow of a man who
had died suddenly while he was in professional attendance upon him,
swindles her out of her property and then abandons her. He now
turns his attention particularly to the practice of procuring abortions.
Three young women, who, to hide their shame, put themselves under his
care, died at his house during one summer, and not many weeks apart.
And not long ago, he was convicted of manslaughter, in causing the death
of a young woman who had resorted to him for the same inhuman
purpose, and of this he was convicted and sentenced for it.</p>

<p class='c015'>It turns out that the man is a native of Ireland, and that his name
was assumed. He was sentenced to the Penitentiary, but who can tell
how soon he may be liberated by an improvident pardon, and find himself
in full practice, under some other name, and in some unsuspicious
community?</p>

<p class='c015'>Why was not his character properly exposed, when, by successive criminal
acts, its settled traits were discovered, at least so far as to put the
unwary on their guard?</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Consumption of Intoxicating Drinks.</span>—Some persons have flattered
themselves and the public that there has been a sensible decrease of the
consumption of ardent spirits in the British Empire, but it is confidently
affirmed that the population statistics and excise returns show a very different
state of things. In 1821, the population of England and Wales
was 11,978,875, and they consumed 7,261,581 gallons of spirits. In
1856, the population was estimated at 20,000,000, and they consumed
13,964,284 gallons, besides over 600,000,000 of ale and beer. In 1821,
the population of Scotland was 2,093,456, and they consumed 2,558,285
gallons of spirits. In 1856, a population of 3,000,000 consumed 7,402,643
gallons. The population of Ireland in 1821, was 6,780,826, and they
consumed 3,340,472 gallons of spirits. The population in 1856, about
the same as in 1821 (famine and pestilence having taken off 1,500,000 of
consumers), they consumed 6,936,938 gallons of spirits. We apprehend
the state of the case is but little, if any, better in these United States.</p>

<hr class='c029'>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Prisons and Prisoners in South Carolina.</span>—In his late message to
the Legislature, the Governor of South Carolina suggests the propriety
of making a breach of trust a higher offence than larceny, and making
the punishment equal, if not more severe. He thinks their system of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>discipline needs reform, (of which, we apprehend, no intelligent citizen
can doubt,) and he justly complains that, while witnesses are subject to
close confinement, prisoners held on criminal charges, have the free range
of the prison!</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Annual Census of the Philadelphia County Prison.</span>—Total number
received during the past year, 19,846, being an increase of 4,933 over
the number the year previous. Of this number 19,822 were discharged—446
to the convict side of the house; 4,604 having served out their time;
25 have died, 3 been pardoned, and one committed suicide. The rest
have been released by magistrates, or acquitted by courts.</p>

grades.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>A Quarter’s Police Work in New York.</span>—The police force of New
York numbers 1,699, and the district embraces the counties of New
York, Kings, Richmond, and West Chester. The expense of the police
for the year is stated to be $1,167,336, or an average of $700 for each
officer. The operations of the last quarter are as follows: Total number
of arrests, 23,971, and of these 16,701 were males, and 7,220 females.
For the same quarter last year there were 21,022 arrests, showing an
increase of 2,949. Four-fifths of the persons arrested were of foreign
birth. Of the offences committed 17,077 were against the person, and
only 3894 against property. Two thirds of the offences were committed
under the influence of intoxicating liquors; 15,917 of the offenders could
read and write; 6,783 had no education whatever; 1,273 cases were not
determined; 12,039 were married; 10,659 unmarried; 1,073 cases not
reported.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Alabama State Prison.</span>—The Governor’s Message states, that there
are 216 convicts in the Penitentiary, of whom six are females. He recommends
the <i>separate</i> system, to be applied to them. The male convicts
are let out to a contractor, who agrees to board them, and pay the State
$1,550 per annum for their labor. A poor bargain in any event.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span><span class='sc'>New York Prison Association.</span>—At the December monthly meeting
of the executive committee of the New York Prison Association, the
report of the agent of the committee of Detention and Discharged Convicts,
showed that during the year then about to close, 5,740 persons
committed to the city prisons were “visited and familiarly spoken with”
by him. In 1,394 cases, circumstances of extenuation were offered, and
hopeful signs exhibited—532 cases were investigated and discontinued
on proper representation—551 were discharged from custody as improperly
held—679 were relieved by small sums of money till they
obtained employment, and 320 were supplied with clothing or employment,
or both. The contributions to the funds of the Association during
the year were but two thousand dollars!</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Deliberate Murder by a Boy under Nine Years of Age.</span>—On the
25th of October, a boy between eight and nine years of age, went to a
neighbor’s house while the elder members of the family were absent, and
with a gun deliberately shot down a girl about twelve years of age,
killing her instantly. The boy, upon being questioned, first said the gun
had fallen accidentally and shot her. He subsequently stated that he
was mad at her, and had killed her! They had attended school together,
and had quarreled. The boy had threatened to shoot the girl, and took
this occasion to carry out his threat. The occurrence took place in Montgomery
county, Pa., a short distance across the Chester county line, from
Valley Forge.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Distribution of Labor in Paris.</span>—A recent inquiry into the occupations
of the laboring people of Paris, with a view to ascertain how far
public improvements now in progress bear favorably on their interests,
shows a very different distribution of labor from that supposed. Of the
360,000 men and women engaged in various trades and handicrafts, it
was apprehended that by far the greater part were employed in building
operations, as masons, carpenters, joiners, painters, &#38;c., but the late
investigation shows that the trade which engrosses the largest amount of
hands is that of tailors and workers in ready made articles of clothing.
In this branch of industry alone, the recent statistics prove 100,000 out
of 360,000 working men and women to be engaged.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>New Jersey State Prison.</span>—We learn that there are now confined in
the State Penitentiary at Trenton 350 convicts. In many of the cells
three prisoners are put together, and some far-seeing newspaper observes,
that unless the prison premises are enlarged, there is danger that the
<i>separate system</i>, which the law requires to be carried out in the prison,
will have to be abandoned! If a man was as near being dead as the
separate system is to being violated there, most doctors would give him up.</p>

  <h2 id='CONSTITUTION' class='c008'><span class='large'>CONSTITUTION</span><br> <span class='small'>OF THE</span><br> <span class='blackletter'>Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When we consider that the obligations of benevolence which are
founded on the precepts and examples of the Author of Christianity,
are not cancelled by the follies or crimes of our fellow-creatures; and
when we reflect upon the miseries which penury, hunger, cold, unnecessary
severity, unwholesome apartments, and guilt, (the usual attendants
of prisons,) involve with them, it becomes us to extend our
compassion to that part of mankind, who are the subjects of those
miseries. By the aid of humanity, their undue and illegal sufferings
may be prevented; the links which should bind the whole family of
mankind together, under all circumstances, be preserved unbroken;
and such degrees and modes of punishment may be discovered and
suggested, as may, instead of continuing habits of vice, become the
means of restoring our fellow-creatures to virtue and happiness.
From a conviction of the truth and obligation of these principles, the
subscribers have associated themselves under the title of “<span class='sc'>The Philadelphia
Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public
Prisons</span>.”</p>

<p class='c015'>For effecting these purposes, they have adopted the following <span class='sc'>Constitution</span>.</p>

<h3 class='c030'>ARTICLE I.</h3>

<p class='c031'>The Officers of the Society shall consist of a President, two Vice-Presidents,
two Secretaries, a Treasurer, two Counsellors, and an acting
Committee; all of whom shall be chosen at the stated meeting to
be held in the first month (January) of each year, and shall continue
in office until their successors are elected; but in case an election
from any cause shall not be then held, it shall be the duty of the
President to call a special meeting of the Society within thirty days,
for the purpose of holding such election, of which at least three days’
notice shall be given.</p>

<h3 class='c030'>ARTICLE II.</h3>

<p class='c031'>The President shall preside in all meetings, and subscribe all public
acts of the Society. He may call special meetings whenever he
may deem it expedient; and shall do so when requested in writing by
five members. In his absence, one of the Vice-Presidents may act
in his place.</p>

<h3 class='c030'>ARTICLE III.</h3>

<p class='c031'>The Secretaries shall keep fair records of the proceedings of the
Society, and shall conduct its correspondence.</p>

<h3 class='c030'>ARTICLE IV.</h3>

<p class='c031'>The Treasurer shall keep the moneys and securities, and pay all orders
of the Society or of the Acting Committee, signed by the presiding
officer and Secretary; and shall present a statement of the condition
of the finances of the Society at each stated meeting thereof.</p>

<h3 class='c030'>ARTICLE V.</h3>

<p class='c031'>The Acting Committee shall consist of the officers of the Society,
<i>ex-officio</i>, and thirty-eight other members. They shall visit the
prison at least twice a month, inquire into the circumstances of the
prisoners, and report such abuses as they shall discover, to the proper
officers appointed to remedy them. They shall examine the influence
of confinement on the morals of the prisoners. They shall keep
regular minutes of their proceedings, which shall he submitted at
every stated meeting of the Society; and shall be authorized to fill
vacancies occurring in their own body. They shall also have the sole
power of electing new members.</p>

<h3 class='c030'>ARTICLE VI.</h3>

<p class='c031'>Candidates for membership may be proposed at any meeting of the
Society or of the Acting Committee; but no election shall take place
within ten days after such nomination. Each member shall pay an
annual contribution of two dollars; but the payment of twenty dollars
at any one time shall constitute a life membership.</p>

<h3 class='c030'>ARTICLE VII.</h3>

<p class='c031'>Honorary members may be elected at such times as the Society may
deem expedient.</p>

<h3 class='c030'>ARTICLE VIII.</h3>

<p class='c031'>The Society shall hold stated meetings on the second third-day
in the months called January, April, July and October, of whom
seven shall constitute a quorum.</p>

<h3 class='c030'>ARTICLE IX.</h3>

<p class='c031'>No alterations of the Constitution shall be made, unless the same
shall have been proposed at a stated meeting of the Society held no
less than a month previous to the adoption of such alterations. All
questions shall be decided where there is a division, by a majority of
votes; in those where the Society is equally divided, the presiding
officer shall have the casting vote.</p>

<h3 class='c030'>PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL OF PRISON DISCIPLINE.</h3>

<p class='c016'>This is a sterling Quarterly, edited with much good sense, kindliness and tact. It vindicates
the policy of solitary confinement, and is generally on the right side. It brings forth “things
new and old,” belabors empiricism, looks upon man in his true condition of sin and misery,
and seeks righteous measures for his reformation. We have always admired the self-relying
sedateness and ingenious ability with which the Editor opens his battery, offensive and defensive;
and he commands a long range and uses unerring projectiles. A wide field is opened for
usefulness in the department of Prison Discipline for men of sense and religion; and we are
glad that there is a valuable Quarterly set for the defence of the truth.—<cite>Pres. Mag.</cite></p>
